# Stock_Price_Prediction
This project has 2 notebooks whose description is as follows:
1. Monte_Carlo_Stock_Simulator: Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique used to model and analyze systems or phenomena through random sampling. It involves using random sampling methods to approximate complex problems that might be deterministic or stochastic in nature.
   A Monte Carlo stock price simulator uses random sampling to model future stock prices, generating numerous potential price paths based on historical data and calculated risk parameters. It estimates future stock prices by simulating various scenarios, accounting for uncertainty and volatility in financial markets.
2. Stacked_lstm: A stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a deep learning architecture comprising multiple LSTM layers, allowing the model to learn hierarchical representations of sequential data by capturing complex patterns and dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction. It enhances the network's capacity to understand intricate temporal relationships within sequences by incorporating multiple LSTM layers one on top of the other.
   A stock price predictor using a stacked LSTM utilizes a hierarchical deep learning structure to analyze historical stock data, capturing intricate temporal patterns and dependencies in the sequences to forecast future price movements, leveraging the network's ability to learn nuanced relationships within the data for predictive analysis.
